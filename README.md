# spark-tests
*p01K*

Set of Apache Spark microbenchmarks(that hopefully stress the Spark scheduler),
to test an alternative scheduling mechanism.

In order to build **spark-tests** you should have built the
https://github.com/p01K/spark01 Spark mirror, (distScheduling branch)
and placed the assembly jar into the lib folder.

Build command : **sbt package**
